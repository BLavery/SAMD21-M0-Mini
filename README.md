# SAMD21-Mini (branded Wemos)
Notes on using the Chinese "SAMD21 M0-Mini" board.

This board in the "nano" sizing has an Atmel/MicroChip SAMD21G18 MCU, and is advertised as "Arduino Zero" compatible.
In hardware, the user LED on D13/PA17 is not fitted, although the PCB design seems to have intended it. As supplied, the Arduino-SAMD bootloader in installed in flash.
